# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Data used to prepare tidy data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/) 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was [obtained](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
The data obtained for this project can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

## This repository is composed by the following files:
- README.md: this file, which provides an overview about the repository contents, purpose of the project and the data used to prepare the tidy data.
- tidy_data_set.txt: file containning the tidy data generated by the run_analysis.R script.
- CodeBook.md: file that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.
- run_analysis.R: the R script written to create the tidy_data_set.txt, which is the main purpose of this project.
